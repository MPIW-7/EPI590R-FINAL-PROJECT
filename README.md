CYTOMEGALOVIRUS

For my project, I analyzed secondary data related to megalovirus. I began by importing the dataset using the here function. Next, I created Table 1, focusing on the outcome variable, "diagnosis type," which is binary (1 = "Myeloid", 0 = "Lymphoid"). Although a log-binomial regression would have been a better fit for this common binary outcome, the model failed to converge, so I opted for binary logistic regression instead. After running the regression, I created a box plot to illustrate the distribution of age by diagnosis type. Additionally, I performed various functions, statistical analyses, and cross-tabulations to further explore the dataset and highlight different aspects of the data frame.
